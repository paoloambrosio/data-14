 * [Software Development environment configuration]

=== Linux ===

 * We need to use {{{__kernel_mode_t}}}, etc. because the GNU compiler defines his own data types ({{{mode_t}}} is 64 bits!); this assures consistency between kernel and user space data. Note that {{{__kernel_dev_t}}} is not definied in user space, so we need to define it {{{__u32}}} in an include file.
 * If during MODPOST you see "{{{WARNING: "rfs_<function>" [<path>/d14flt.ko] undefined!}}}", just copy Module.symvers from RedirFS directory to the filter directory. It will be merged with the symbols from the filter automatically.
 * [VFSOperations Changes in Linux VFS operations] from version 2.6.11

=== Windows ===

 * Generic [WindowsFS Windows File System considerations]
 * Windows ACLs are fare more complex than just IDs, but the creation event is an atomic event so we can't split it in create and attributes changes.
 * A file opened by id in Windows gets a random name from one of its hard links names.
 * In the FILE_OBJECT structure there is no parent directory FileIndex information, so we need to open it and get its FileIndex on create, rename and delete calls.
